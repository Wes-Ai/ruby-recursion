# ruby-recursion

A small project to practive recursion.


1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively.
